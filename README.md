# Developing_Data_Products_Project


## Introduction
This project is for the Week 3 Assignment of Developing Data Product course of the Coursera Data Science Specialization. 

The goal of this project is to create a Shiny application, deploy it on Rstudio's servers, and use RStudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about the Shiny application.

In this project, I use the motor trend car road tests dataset to develop a model to predict a new car's MPG. The Shiny application will predict a new car's miles per gallon (MPG) based on user's input about the car's characteristics.


## Shiny Application

Provide your input (number of cylinders, displacement, horsepower and weight) in the left side panel.

The main panel will show the predicted MPG in the main panel. 

## Pitch Presentation

A 5-slide pitch presentation showing the content and rationale of the Shiny App.
